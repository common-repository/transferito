= How our plugin works =

We pride our WordPress migration plugin on being a real 1-Click WordPress duplicator / migrator plugin. That just works!

We've worked hard to simplify the WordPress migration process and make it easier than ever to move your WordPress site to new domain or to a new host.

We have two migration methods:
1. Manually enter your SFTP/FTP and database details
2. Enter your cPanel login & choose your domain - Then your database & FTP details are created automatically for you. Making WordPress migrations even easier. Brilliant for the less technical user.

Once you click the "Start Migration" button. We export your WordPress site and then automatically (Yes.. you read that correctly!) migrate your WordPress site with updated links & URLs to your new location.
